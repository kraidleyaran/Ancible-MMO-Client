  - "Killing monsters will reward you with experience and gold! If you're lucky,
    they may even drop an item!\n\nTo loot a monster, right click on the chest. If
    any items have dropped, you will see a new loot window pop up.\n\nYou can auto
    loot a chest by right clicking on it again after the loot window has appeared.
    \n\nOnce an item is looted, you can press the I key to view items you have in
    your inventory."
